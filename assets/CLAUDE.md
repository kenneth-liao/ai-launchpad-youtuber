# Youtube Channel Assets

Ready-to-use assets are available for composing high-converting thumbnails that follow a consistent visual identity for the channel. These assets include premade thumbnail templates, headshots, icons/logos, and proven thumbnail designs.

## Youtube Thumbnail Templates

You can use premade thumbnail templates if relevant to the thumbnail concept. These templates are a starting point for common thumbnail design patterns such as before/after transformations, etc.

See `assets/thumbnail_templates/reference.md` for the full list of available templates. Thumbnail template image files are in `assets/thumbnail_templates`.

## Headshots

My headshots are in `assets/headshots`. See `assets/headshots/reference.md` for the full list of available headshots and their intended usage.

If the thumbnail concept calls for the creator's headshot, you **MUST ALWAYS** use headshots from `assets/headshots` instead of prompting thumbkit to generate them from descriptions. Headshot image files should be passed to thumbkit as reference images.

## Icons/Logos

Icons/Logos are in `assets/icons`. See `assets/icons/reference.md` for the full list of available icons/logos and their intended usage.

You **MUST ALWAYS** use official icons/logos from `assets/icons` instead of prompting thumbkit to generate them from descriptions. Official icon/logo files should be passed to thumbkit as reference images.

## Proven Thumbnail Designs

Proven thumbnail designs are in `assets/proven_thumbnail_designs`. See `assets/proven_thumbnail_designs/reference.md` for the full list of available proven thumbnail designs and their intended usage.

**MANDATORY:** For this project, you **MUST** bias towards using proven thumbnail designs from `assets/proven_thumbnail_designs`. Only deviate if there is no relevant proven thumbnail design.
