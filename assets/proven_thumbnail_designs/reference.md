## Usage Tips

1. **Match the energy:** Choose thumbnails that match your video's tone (educational vs. hype vs. serious)
2. **Consider text placement:** Note where text appears in each example for your own text overlay
3. **Color psychology:** Green = money/success, Red = warning/bad, Yellow = attention/highlight
4. **Expression matters:** The person's expression should match the promise of the video
5. **Composition balance:** Most examples balance person + visual element + text in thirds
