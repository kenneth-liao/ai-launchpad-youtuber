### 2. Before/After Split (Tutorials/Transformations)

Why it works: Instantly communicates change; curiosity to see how.

#### Composition notes

- 50/50 split with a clean dividing line. Keep both halves uncluttered; strong contrast between states.

#### Variations

- A. This image is a split-screen "before and after" comparison, divided by a sharp, glowing green diagonal line.

The "before" half on the left is dark teal and blue, featuring a digital aesthetic with glowing cyan circuit board lines, faint binary code, and dotted grids, suggesting complexity or an older technology.

The "after" half on the right is bright, clean, and minimalist, rendered in soft beige and light blue gradients. It has very few, thin, white circuit-like lines, implying simplicity, clarity, or a new, improved state.
